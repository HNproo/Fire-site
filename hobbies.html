    <p class="para" id="chessp"> I started playing chess in March of 2023 and in that time I managed to climb up to 1757 ELO on chess.com which puts me in the 1.5 percentile of players.
        I originally started playing chess as a competition with a friend of mine, after racing each other back and forth eventually, I managed to come out on top, that long 
        lasting competition resulted in chess being more than just a board game for me, it became memories with a friend. The thing I love about that game is that it teaches you 
        to take responsibilty for your own actions and what i mean by that is when you lose a match, it's no ones fault except your own, at some point you made a mistake, it might 
        be a move you didn't see, a tactic from an opponent you missed or a piece you blundered, in one way or another it's your fault.

     <p id="guitarpara" class="para"> I started playing the guitar somewhere in the beginning of 2023, the reason that happened is due to my love for music, music has always been a big part
        of my life and it managed to help me through tough times and made good times better. My first guitar was a black acoustic guitar with light gold touches all over its body, I managed 
        to teach myself throughout the years and learned a lot of my favorite songs such as hotel california by the Eagles or Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin, my second guitar was gifted
        from my grandfather, its an old classical guitar, and my third and last guitar was a blue and white electric guitar.
