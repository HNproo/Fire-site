  <b> This site was made as a training exercise for me to be able to get better,<br>
    this is the first site with multiple working pages, in fact this site was made
    using <br>codes from previous projects, for example the animation used in the home 
    screen was<br> used before in a site made before for sports wear, the colors and the <br> angle 
    were just changed. Thats the beauty of coding, the more you<br> do it the easier it is, you can
    easily reuse previous batches <br> of codes to make your life easier.
